To calculate the final amount of an investment with a lump sum using compound interest, you can use the formula:

\[ A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{n \times t} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the final amount,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal),
- \( t \) is the number of years,
- \( n \) is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.

In your case:
- \( P = 100 \) (initial investment),
- \( r = 0.15 \) (annual interest rate, as a decimal),
- \( t = 30 \) (number of years),
- \( n = 1 \) (assuming interest is compounded annually).

Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 \times \left(1 + \frac{0.15}{1}\right)^{1 \times 30} \]
\[ A = 100 \times (1.15)^{30} \]

Now, calculate \( (1.15)^{30} \):

\[ (1.15)^{30} \approx 66.21 \]

(You can use a calculator for this precise value.)

Then,

\[ A = 100 \times 66.21 \]
\[ A = 6621 \]

So, the final amount after 30 years with a 15% annual return is approximately \( 6621 \).
