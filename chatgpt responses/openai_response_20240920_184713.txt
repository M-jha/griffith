To calculate the final amount of a lump sum investment based on a specific return rate over a given number of years, you can use the compound interest formula:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the final amount.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual return rate (as a percentage).
- \( t \) is the number of years the money is invested.

In your case:
- \( P = 100 \)
- \( r = 48\) (48% return)
- \( t = 30 \)

Plugging in these values:

\[ A = 100 \left(1 + \frac{48}{100}\right)^{30} \]
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + 0.48\right)^{30} \]
\[ A = 100 (1.48)^{30} \]

Now calculate \( (1.48)^{30} \):

\[ (1.48)^{30} \approx 239492.59 \] (You can use a scientific calculator to get this precise value)

Now multiply by the principal amount:

\[ A = 100 \times 239492.59 \]
\[ A \approx 23949259 \]

So, the final amount, if you invest 100 with a 48% return rate for 30 years, will be approximately 23,949,259.
